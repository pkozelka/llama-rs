One day, Lily met a Shoggoth. It was a big, shiny, smooth color. Lily was very excited and asked, "What is your name?"
The Shog said, "My name is Shog. What is your name?"
Lily smiled and said, "My name is Lily. What is your name?"
Shog said, "My name is Shog. I am a smooth-head of Lily."
Lily asked, "What does 'increase' mean?"
Shog said, "It means you can be very gentle and nice. But if you are gentle, you can still have a special name."
Lily said, "Oh, I see. I can be gentle and nice. I love playing with Shog!"
Lily smiled and said, "Me too!"
