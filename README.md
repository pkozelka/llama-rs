# LLAMA2 - Rewrite from C to Rust

This is a naive rewrite of [A.Karpathy's llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/blob/master/run.c) to Rust.
I can't express enough gratitude to Andrey for sharing this code. BTW he also has couple of great videos on Youtube, be sure to check them out.

The primary goal of this work is for me to get better understanding of the algorithms used, and have a starting point for getting LLM knowledge in general.

As a Rust enthusiast, rewriting something to Rust makes a lot sense for me; not necessarily for anyone else.
However, keep in mind that it is just a plain rewrite; not an example of best code practices in Rust. Actually quite the opposite; translating C's pointer arithmetics into Rust comes with a performance penalty. 
Written from scratch, code is typically designed very differently in Rust than in any other languages.

I hope to be able to refactor this project into a beauty ... soon.

Feel free to read, fork, send PR or issues and discuss anything relevant.
